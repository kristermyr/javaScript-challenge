# Password Generator

## Description
The Password Generator showcases my newly learned skills in Javascript. I have learned an introduction in how Javascript can make a website more interactive and make options for the user. 
I learned how you can take the users input of numbers and boolean value, use that information to present an answer based on the users input and respond with a statement or an action. I leaned how to take information from an array and sending the user a random value from that list and that console.log() can be extremely helpful while trouble shooting trying to find an error in the code.
